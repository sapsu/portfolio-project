# portfolio-project

Improved and responsive portfolio website to showcase my projects. Done as an assignment for SheCodes Responsive workshop. https://www.shecodes.io/

Technologies/tools used:

- Figma to design the layout and overall look of the page. (I did it myself, utlizing what I learned on an udemy Figma course, yay!)
- HTML, Bootstrap, some vanilla CSS, Google fonts, Fontawesome.
- Images from my own collection.

  The website is hosted on netlify: https://jovial-strudel-724475.netlify.app/
